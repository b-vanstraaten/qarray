QArray documentation
==================================

Welcome to the QArray documentation! QArray is an open-source software package designed to accelerate the simulation of charge stability diagrams for large quantum dot arrays using the constant capacitance model. We have leveraged the capabilities of GPU acceleration through JAX and parallel computation via Rust, allowing you to compute the charge state of quantum dot arrays significantly faster than existing implementations.

For the accompanying paper, see `ArXiv <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04994>`_.
